# `replication`

This repository contains my attempts to replicate famous results from influential papers in machine learning and computer vision. The goal is to understand these seminal works by implementing them from scratch and reproducing their key findings.

## 🎯 Objectives

- **Deep Understanding**: Go beyond reading papers to truly understand the methodologies by implementing them
- **Reproducibility**: Verify that published results can be replicated with proper implementation
- **Learning**: Gain hands-on experience with foundational techniques and architectures
- **Documentation**: Provide clear, well-documented implementations for educational purposes

## 📚 Current Replications

### CLIP (Contrastive Language-Image Pre-training)

## 📖 References

## 📝 Notes

This repository represents an ongoing learning journey. Each implementation prioritizes:
- **Clarity**: Code is written to be understood, not just to work
- **Completeness**: No TODOs or placeholders - fully functional implementations
- **Documentation**: Thorough comments explaining the reasoning behind design choices
